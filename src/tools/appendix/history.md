**Example**:
As for the long term fire history, a study by Guiterman et al. (2015) used dendroecological methods (tree-ring analysis) to reconstruct a high-severity fire that occurred in 1993 in a ponderosa pine-dominated forest. The historical fire regime (1625-1871) at this site was characterized by frequent, low-severity fires, usually in dry years following wet years. Notably, fires ceased after 1871, coinciding with increased livestock grazing in the region.
