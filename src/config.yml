  Here are the descriptions of the three datasets to choose from, they are:

  - Fire Weather Index (FWI): The Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. The FWI is used to assess the potential trends fire danger towards the Mid-Century (2045 - 2054) and the end of the Century (2085 - 2094), and compare against the historical period (1995 - 2004). Choose this dataset if you want to analyze the trends in fire danger and understand the potential changes in fire risk over time.

  - Long term fire history records: The metadata from the North American Tree-ring Fire Scar Synthesis (NAFSS) provides a rich dataset including scientific studies derived from tree-ring records across North America, capturing centuries of wildfire occurrences. This dataset can be instrumental in analyzing wildfire risk by providing historical context and identifying patterns or cycles in wildfire activity in the long term. Choose this dataset if you want to analyze the long-term patterns of wildfire activity throughout history.

  - Recent fire incident data: Wildland Fire Interagency Geospatial Services (WFIGS) Group wildfire incidents record allows you to retrieve yearly and monthly wildfire incident counts between 2015 and 2023. Choose this dataset if you want to analyze the recent fire incidents in the area and make recommendations on immediate actions to mitigate the risks.

  - Census data: This is a subset of the 2020 US Census data that includes population counts, number of housing units, and poverty rates for each cencus block group in the United States. Choose this dataset if you want to analyze the population distribution and poverty rates in the area to understand the potential impact of wildfires on the local community.
