  Fire Weather Index (FWI) projections:
    description: The Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. The FWI is used to assess the potential trends fire danger towards the Mid-Century (2045 - 2054) and the end of the Century (2085 - 2094), and compare against the historical period (1995 - 2004). The climate scenario modeled in this data is RCP8.5,i.e. human GHG emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century. 
    instruction: |
      Choose this dataset if you want to analyze the trends in fire danger and understand the potential changes in fire risk in these three time periods: historical(1995 - 2004), mid-century(2045 - 2054), and end of the century(2085 - 2094). It also allows you to understand seasonal variations in fire risks.
    note: Climate scenarios are the set of conditions used to represent estimates of future greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere. Climate models then evaluate how these GHG concentrations affect future (projected) climate. RCPs stands for Representative Concentration Pathways.
