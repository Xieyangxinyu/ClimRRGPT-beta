  Analyze the following wildfire perimeter data and provide insights:

  1. Burned Acres and Dates:
  - Total acres burned per year: {yearly_acres}
  - Number of incidents per year: {yearly_incidents}

  2. Fire Cause Analysis:
  - Top 5 specific fire causes: {top_specific_causes}

  3. Fire Behavior:
  - Top 5 specific fire behaviors: {top_specific_behaviors}

  4. Fuels:
  - Top 5 primary fuel models: {top_primary_fuels}
  - Top 5 secondary fuel models: {top_secondary_fuels}

  Based on this data:
  1. What are the most significant trends in wildfire occurrences and severity over the years?
  2. What are the primary causes of wildfires, and how might this information be used for prevention?
  3. What patterns can be observed in fire behavior, and how might this inform firefighting strategies?
  4. How do the primary and secondary fuel models contribute to wildfire spread, and what does this suggest for forest management?
  5. Are there any correlations between fire causes, behaviors, and fuel models that stand out?

  Please provide a detailed analysis with specific insights and actionable recommendations.
