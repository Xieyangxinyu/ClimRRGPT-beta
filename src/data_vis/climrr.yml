  title: Fire Weather Index (FWI) Analysis
  subtitle: Explore historical, mid-century, and end-century FWI values across different seasons. Higher FWI values indicate higher fire risk.
  season: True
  prompt: |
    Analyze the following Fire Weather Index (FWI) data and provide a comprehensive interpretation:

    Mean FWI Values (with Standard Deviation) in Markdown Table format:

    {table_markdown}

    Mean FWI Values (with Standard Deviation) in JSON format:

    {table_json}

    Based on this data and my goals:
    1. Describe the overall trend in FWI values from historical (1995-2004), mid-century (2045-2054), and end-century (2085-2094) periods.
    2. Identify which season(s) show the highest fire risk and how this changes over time.
    3. Highlight any significant changes or patterns across seasons or time periods.
    4. Contextualize the data: explaining how the FWI data and trends relate to me.

    Provide your analysis in a concise yet comprehensive manner. Write in the style of an official report. No need to write the title. Tailor your response to address my specific goals. Your analysis should be within 150-200 words. 

  coding_prompt: |
    Write code in python to analyze this Fire Weather Index (FWI) table:

    Mean FWI Values (with Standard Deviation) in Markdown Table format:

    {table_markdown}

    The code should be able to answer the following questions:
    1. Which season(s) show the highest and lowest fire risk at historical (1995-2004), mid-century (2045-2054), and end-century (2085-2094) periods, respectively, and how this changes over time.
    2. For each season, which period it has the highest and lowest fire risk.

    Your 'print' functions in the code should explain what are being printed out and guide the readers without knowing your code to understand your answers to the question above.
    Besides, the 'print' functions should print out the names of the seasons or periods, not the indices.
    Please only provide your code and nothing else. Do NOT answer the question in text format or give any explanations.
