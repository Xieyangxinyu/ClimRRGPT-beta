  Analyze the following census data for a specific region, focusing on wildfire risk and infrastructure resilience:

  Regional Summary:
  - Total Population: {total_population}
  - Total Housing Units: {total_housing_units}
  - Median Household Income: {median_household_income}
  - Poverty Rate: {total_poverty_rate}
  - Elderly Population Rate: {elderly_population_rate}
  - Single Unit Housing Rate: {single_unit_housing_rate}
  - New Housing Rate (built 2010 or later): {new_housing_rate}
  - No Vehicle Available Rate: {no_vehicle_rate}
  - Internet Access Rate: {internet_access_rate}

  Based on this data, please provide an analysis tailored to my goals. You may start with the following points:

  1. Vulnerability Assessment:
     - How might the elderly population rate impact evacuation efforts in case of a wildfire?
     - What challenges could arise from the proportion of households without vehicles in terms of evacuation?

  2. Housing and Infrastructure:
     - What implications does the single unit housing rate have for wildfire spread and firefighting efforts?
     - How might the age of housing structures (new housing rate) affect their resilience to wildfires?
     - How could internet access rates influence emergency communications and early warning systems?

  3. Economic Factors:
     - How might median household income relate to residents' ability to implement fire safety measures or recover from wildfire damage?

  4. Overall Risk Profile:
     - Based on these factors, assess the overall wildfire risk profile of this region.
     - Identify which aspects make the region most vulnerable and which provide resilience.

  Provide your analysis in a concise yet comprehensive manner. Write in the style of an official report. No need to write the title. Tailor your response to address my specific goals. Your analysis should be within 150-200 words.
