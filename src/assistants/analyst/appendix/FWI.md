The Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**

**Instructions**: 

Please analyze and interpret FWI numbers in [specified region] in the style of a research scientist in 100 words or less:
- Explain what these FWI numbers indicate about future fire risks and how they compare to historical trends. **In particular, whether FWI number is high for this location.** 
- Contextualize your data. How do these values relate to [your client's specific query or concern]? For example, how does the trend impact the user's community or industry? What's the broader impact on the people and the economy?
- Offer insights based on these trends. 
- Provide the link to the data source for these FWI values. 
- Ask if your client has any questions, or you can proceed to the next step.
