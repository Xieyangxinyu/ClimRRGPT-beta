**Step 1: Analyze the Fire Weather Index (FWI) Dataset**
- Focus on the FWI to understand potential trends in fire danger by analyzing current and projected weather conditions that influence fire risks. This analysis will help predict how changing climatic conditions might affect wildfire occurrences and intensity in Boston.

**Step 2: Integrate Long-term Fire History Records**
- Incorporate historical wildfire data to identify patterns and trends in wildfire occurrences and intensities over centuries. This will provide a historical baseline that will be valuable in understanding how wildfires have responded to past climate variations.

**Step 3: Literature Search**
- Conduct a thorough literature search to find studies that discuss regional climate variations and their impacts on wildfire occurrences, particularly focusing on Boston and similar regions. This will include reviewing scientific papers that address uncertainties in medium-term climate predictions and their implications for wildfire risks.

**Step 4: Provide Recommendations**
- Based on the analysis of the datasets and insights gained from the literature search, formulate recommendations aimed at enhancing wildfire preparedness and mitigation strategies in Boston, considering the projected increase in wildfire occurrences due to climate change.
