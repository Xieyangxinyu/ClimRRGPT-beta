The recent fire incident data in the Naperville region shows a limited number of occurrences between 2015 and 2022, with wildfires reported only in the years 2018 and 2021. The months with recorded incidents were March (2 incidents) and July (1 incident). This pattern may indicate that wildfire risks in the area are relatively low, but seasonal peaks in early spring and mid-summer suggest times of heightened vulnerability.

This data contextualizes the wildfire threat for Napheaperville, and impact management strategies for both community safety and vegetation conservation, especially concerning oak ecosystems. Understanding these temporal trends assists in targeted fire management practices to minimize risks.

1. Title: Dynamics of a Managed Oak Woodland in Northeastern Illinois
Authors: Amanda Stan, Lesley Rigg, Linda Jones
Year: 2006.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.3375/0885-8608(2006)26[187:doamow]2.0.co;2
Abstract: Abstract We examined the current composition and structure of a woodland in northeastern Illinois and evaluated the early effect of two prescribed burns. In an effort to increase white oak (Quercus alba L.) regeneration, managers are reintroducing fire into the woodland understory. We assessed canopy species and compared understory vegetation and light, along with soil nutrient characteristics, between a burned and an unburned area. In addition, we monitored transplanted white oak seedlings to better understand their growth and survivorship in the woodland. The canopy was dominated by white oak, but non-oak species, particularly slippery elm (Ulmus rubra Muhl.), ash (Fraxinus spp. L), and black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), dominated the smaller size classes. There were no differences in woody and herbaceous vegetation, soil, and light characteristics between the burned and unburned area. White oak regeneration was poor which appeared to be due to low understory light levels associated with high density...

2. Title: Response of advance reproduction of oaks and associated species to repeated prescribed fires in upland oak-hickory forests, Missouri
Authors: Zhaofei Fan et al.
Year: 2012.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.08.034
Abstract: The Chilton Creek prescribed burn project was initiated in 1996 by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to restore native oak woodlands and test the effect of frequent, low intensity surface fires conducted in the dormant season (March–April) on upland oak-hickory forests in the Ozarks of Missouri. Burning treatments on five sites totaling 1000 ha were initiated in 1998. The prescribed burn treatments included: annual burns (one site was burned annually) and periodic burns (four sites were burned with a mean fire return interval of approximately 4 years). Approximately 3000 stems of advance reproduction with basal diameters 615.0 cm were measured in 1997 (pre-burn), and remeasured in 1998, 2001 and 2007 as the prescribed burn treatments proceeded. Mortality and changes in average and aggregate total height between 1997 and 2007 were analyzed for fourteen selected tree species. Over a ten-year period prescribed burning reduced stem density, mean height and aggregate height by 57%, 36% and 67%, respectively. However, individual tree species responded differently to the repeated burns. Oaks exhibited moderate mortality (36–54%) compared to hickories, sassafras and winged elm, all of which experienced relatively low mortality (18–35%). Flowering dogwood, shortleaf pine, blackgum and other minor species incurred higher mortality (60–76%). Oaks generally had slightly lower reductions in mean height and aggregate height than associated species with the exception of shortleaf pine, but the differences were mostly non-significant. Repeated burning tended to favor the white oak species (white oak, post oak, chinkapin oak) more than the red oak species (black oak, scarlet oak), although the differences were minor. Shortleaf pine was the only species to show increases in mean height following the

3. Title: A Review on the Dynamics of Prescribed Fire, Tree Mortality, and Injury in Managing Oak Natural Communities to Minimize Economic Loss in North America
Authors: Daniel Dey, Callie Schweitzer
Year: 2018.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/f9080461
Abstract: The long history of fire in North America spans millennia and is recognized as an important driver in the widespread and long-term dominance of oak species and oak natural communities. Frequent wildfires from about 1850 to 1950 resulted in much forest damage, and gained fire a negative reputation. The lack of fire for the past nearly 100 years due to suppression programs is now indicted as a major cause of widespread oak regeneration failures and loss of fire-dependent natural communities. The use of prescribed fire is increasing in forest management and ecosystem restoration. An understanding of fire effects on trees can provide the basis for the silviculture of restoring and sustaining oak ecosystems. We present an overview of fire-tree wounding interactions, highlight important determinants of fire injury and damage, and discuss several practical situations where fire can be used to favor oak while minimizing damage and devaluation of the forest. We also identify stages in stand development, regeneration methods, and management objectives for which fire has the potential of causing substantial damage and recommend preferred alternative practices.

Recent research highlights the strategic implementation of controlled burns in March, particularly focusing on oak ecosystems in locations similar to Illinois. Amanda Stan, Lesley Rigg, and Linda Jones’ study (2006) suggests that reintroducing fire in March into northeastern Illinois’ oak woodlands is part of a management strategy aimed at boosting white oak regeneration, yet underscored the challenge of achieving adequate light levels for optimal growth (Stan, Rigg, & Jones, 2006). 

Zhaofei Fan and colleagues (2012) extend this research, noting that prescribed burns in Missouri's upland oak-hickory forests during the dormant season yield differential impacts across species, with moderate success in promoting oak health (Fan et al., 2010). 

Furthermore, Daniel Dey and Callie Schweitzer (2018) emphasize the broader historical context and potential of prescribed burns in managing oak natural communities, offering insights into optimal uses of fire to support oak dominance while minimizing economic impacts and enhancing ecological resilience (Dey & Schweitzer, 2018).

This body of research underscores the importance of March burns in oak ecosystem management plans, suggesting that your period of controlled burns is both strategic and supported by evidence aimed at achieving long-term sustainability and resilience of these vital ecosystems.

The Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**

The Fire Weather Index (FWI) data for the Naperville region shows a consistent pattern of fire risk across different seasons, both historically and projected into the future. Historically, the risk is low to medium, with the highest values in the summer and autumn, peaking around 16.42 and 16.62 respectively. This trend is projected to persist into the mid and end of the century, with slight increases in summer and autumn by the end of the century.

These projections suggest that fire risks in your area will remain relatively stable over time, with no significant increase in wildfire danger, allowing for continued use of controlled burns as a management strategy without escalating risks significantly. However, monitoring these trends will be crucial to adapt management practices in response to any future changes in weather patterns.
