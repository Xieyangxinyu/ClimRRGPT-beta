**Step 1: Recent Fire Incident Data Analysis**
- Analyze the Recent Fire Incident Data for Mora County, focusing on wildfire frequency, intensity, and timing from 2015 to 2023. This step will provide insight into current trends and preliminary indicators of climate impact on wildfires.

**Step 2: Long-term Fire History Records Analysis**
- Examine Long-term Fire History Records to establish historical patterns of wildfire occurrences. This analysis helps in understanding the historical cycles and their correlation with climatic conditions.

**Step 3: Climate Change Impact Analysis Using FWI**
- To specifically address climate change impacts, analyze the Fire Weather Index (FWI). This includes assessing projected mid-century (2045-2054) and end-of-century (2085-2094) fire risks under anticipated climate scenarios. Comparisons against historical FWI data will highlight potential changes in fire danger levels.

**Step 4: Literature Review on Climate Change and Wildfire Risks**
- Conduct a comprehensive literature search focusing on the impacts of climate change on wildfire behavior, particularly relating to climatic variables and wildfire patterns in similar regions.

**Step 5: Recommendations and Adaptation Strategies**
- Based on insights from data analyses and literature reviews, develop strategic recommendations including adaptive measures for mitigation, enhanced monitoring systems, community education on fire prevention, and updates to local planning to improve resilience against increased fire risks due to climate change.
