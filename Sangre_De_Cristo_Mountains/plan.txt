**Step 1: Analyze Recent Fire Incident Data**
- Analyze recent fire incident data from the Wildland Fire Interagency Geospatial Services Group to assess the frequency, intensity, and locations of recent wildfires. This helps identify areas affected by high-intensity fires needing immediate attention.

**Step 2: Review Fire Weather Index (FWI)**
- Examine the Fire Weather Index data to understand current fire risks and predict potential future fire behaviors. This assists in preparing effective response strategies and enhancing emergency services readiness based on weather conditions influencing fire risks.

**Step 3: Conduct Literature Search**
- Search for scientific literature on effective post-wildfire recovery strategies, focusing on public safety and environmental restoration. This includes reviewing studies on community preparedness programs, emergency response effectiveness, and environmental mitigation techniques.

**Step 4: Formulate Recommendations**
- Provide recommendations based on the analysis of recent fire incidents, FWI data, and literature search findings. Focus on improving emergency services, updating community preparedness programs, and implementing environmental restoration initiatives with the US Army Corps of Engineers.

**Step 5: Final Review and Feedback**
- Present findings and recommendations, then seek feedback to ensure strategies align with expectations and specific needs of the Sangre De Cristo Mountains community. Adjust the approach based on input to better address the concerns.
