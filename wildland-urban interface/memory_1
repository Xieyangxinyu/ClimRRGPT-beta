user: It seems like there is higher risk in the spring at the end of century even though historically it is riskier in the fall?


assistant: That's an astute observation. While historically the fall season has shown a higher risk of wildfires in the area, the FWI projections indicate a potential shift in the seasonal fire risk. The end-of-century projections suggest an increase in fire danger during the spring season, surpassing the historical fall season risk.

This shift in the seasonal fire risk emphasizes the importance of considering the evolving patterns of fire danger as a result of climate change. It's crucial to adapt risk management and mitigation strategies to account for these changing patterns, especially when planning for urban development and housing in wildfire-prone areas.

Given this, it's important to explore specific and targeted risk management and housing development strategies that can accommodate these projected changes in seasonal fire risk.

Before we proceed, do you have any further questions about the FWI data or would you like to explore any other aspects related to wildfires and climate change in this area between Las Vegas and Montezuma?


user: Do you have potential explanation for this?


assistant: The potential shift in the seasonal fire risk, with the spring season showing higher future fire danger compared to the historical fall season, could be attributed to several factors influenced by climate change. These factors may include changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, fuel availability, and ecosystem dynamics.

For example, with climate change, temperatures are projected to rise, leading to an earlier onset of warmer and drier conditions in the spring. Warmer spring temperatures may result in earlier snowmelt, dry vegetation, and an extended fire season. These changes can significantly impact the availability of fuels, increasing the susceptibility of the landscape to fires during the spring.

Moreover, alterations in precipitation patterns can affect the moisture content of vegetation, affecting the fuel availability and fire risk. Changes in precipitation may lead to a drier spring season, further exacerbating fire danger.

Ecosystem dynamics, including the composition and structure of vegetation, can also contribute to the shift in seasonal fire risk. As vegetation responds to changing climate conditions, the distribution and abundance of different vegetation types may shift, influencing the overall fuel characteristics and fire behavior during different seasons.

Understanding these potential explanations and considering the specific local conditions and dynamics in the area between Las Vegas and Montezuma is crucial for developing targeted wildfire risk management strategies and housing development plans.

Given these potential explanations, it's important to further explore the specific local conditions and factors that may be contributing to the projected shift in seasonal fire risk. Is there any additional information or specific research focus that you would like to explore regarding the potential explanations for the projected shift in seasonal fire risk in this area?


user: You said change in snowmelt, dry vegetation, and an extended fire season can significantly impact the availability of fuels, increasing the susceptibility of the landscape to fires during the spring. Is this backed by scientific research?

1. Title: Drought, multi-seasonal climate, and wildfire in northern New Mexico
Authors: E. Margolis, C. Woodhouse, T. Swetnam
Year: 2017.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-1958-4
Abstract: Wildfire is increasingly a concern in the USA, where 10 million acres burned in 2015. Climate is a primary driver of wildfire, and understanding fire-climate relationships is crucial for informing fire management and modeling the effects of climate change on fire. In the southwestern USA, fire-climate relationships have been informed by tree-ring data that extend centuries prior to the onset of fire exclusion in the late 1800s. Variability in cool-season precipitation has been linked to fire occurrence, but the effects of the summer North American monsoon on fire are less understood, as are the effects of climate on fire seasonality. We use a new set of reconstructions for cool-season (October–April) and monsoon-season (July–August) moisture conditions along with a large new fire scar dataset to examine relationships between multi-seasonal climate variability, fire extent, and fire seasonality in the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico (1599–1899 CE). Results suggest that large fires burning in all seasons are strongly influenced by the current year cool-season moisture, but fires burning mid-summer to fall are also influenced by monsoon moisture. Wet conditions several years prior to the fire year during the cool season, and to a lesser extent during the monsoon season, are also important for spring through late-summer fires. Persistent cool-season drought longer than 3 years may inhibit fires due to the lack of moisture to replenish surface fuels. This suggests that fuels may become increasingly limiting for fire occurrence in semi-arid regions that are projected to become drier with climate change.

2. Title: Droughts and Wildfires in Western U.S. Rangelands
Authors: John Scasta, John Weir, Michael Stambaugh
Year: 2016.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rala.2016.06.003
Abstract: On the Ground Because fire activity fluctuates with short- and long-term term weather and climate trends, understanding trends relative to climate forecasts is critical to mitigating the loss of life and property and rapid vegetation state changes. Through the analysis of charcoal and trees scars, historical droughts and fire patterns can be quantified retrospectively for hundreds of years. This evidence suggests that generally fire was most frequent during warm-dry periods as opposed to cool-moist periods. However, arid regions may see an increase of fire activity with an increase of moisture due to inherent fuel load limitations. Using federal wildfire and weather data from 2002 to 2015 for New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, and Wyoming, we demonstrate that the worst wildfire activity occurred after average or above average precipitation years followed by drought in Oklahoma and Wyoming. Nevada wildfire activity was correlated with precipitation the preceding year, and NewMexico wildfire activity was not cor...

3. Title: Interannual variability of wildfires and summer precipitation in the Southwest
Authors: David Gutzler, Laura Alst
Year: 2010.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.58799/nmg-v32n1.22
Abstract: As described in the accompanying Gallery of Geology article, springtime is wildfire season in the Southwest. The table of recent fires in New Mexico on page 25 is dominated by events in May and June. Hot, dry, windy conditions in the spring promote wildfire development. Drought conditions make some years more fire prone than others, and long-term climatic changes in temperature and precipitation affect the general fire regime in the Southwest (Meyer and Frechette, this issue). The onset of the North American monsoon, usually around the beginning of July, brings higher humidity and intermittent rainfall, dampening grass and dry fuel and generally marking the end of the fire season (and the acceleration of plant growth that provides fuel for the next year's fire season). It is also possible that wildfires affect the regional climate, although this connection is harder to quantify. Large fires inject large quantities of soot and smoke high into the atmosphere. Winds then blow these particulates across the Southwest, so the impact of locally injected particulates can spread far beyond the source. Other sources of particulates, such as widespread air pollution, have been shown to block sunlight and depress precipitation. A study of the South Asian monsoon showed that black carbon soot associated with air pollution decreases the radiative heating of the surface, thereby altering atmospheric stability and largescale temperature gradients that drive monsoon circulations (Ramanathan et al. 2005). Compared to the South Asian brown cloud, southwestern wildfires in most years generate much smaller quantities of particulates that remain airborne for a shorter period of time. However the timing of the southwestern fire season in late spring is potentially just right to affect the onset of the monsoon. The onset date is highly correlated with total seasonal precipitation, such that late onset is usually a precursor of low total summer rainfall (Higgins et al. 1997). We describe here a preliminary assessment of the hypothesis that large spring wildfires could depress monsoonal precipitation, by comparing a 25-yr time series of acreage burned in southwestern wildfires in June with the subsequent precipitation observed in July and August (Van Alst 2009).
