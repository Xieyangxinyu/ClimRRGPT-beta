**Step 1: Analyze the Fire Weather Index (FWI) Dataset**
- Focus on the projected data for the Mid-Century period (2045 - 2054) to understand potential trends in fire danger. This analysis will help predict future fire behavior and danger levels, crucial for planning the development of housing and managing water resources in a wildfire-prone area.

**Step 2: Analyze the Long Term Fire History Records**
- Examine historical patterns and trends in wildfire activity to provide context for understanding how wildfires have historically impacted the region, essential for assessing the risk to new urban developments and water resources.

**Step 3: Literature Search**
- Search for scientific papers focusing on wildfire management and mitigation strategies, particularly in areas similar to Las Vegas, NM. This includes exploring effective measures for protecting urban interfaces from wildfires and strategies for safeguarding water resources during and after wildfires.

**Step 4: Recommendations**
- Provide detailed recommendations based on the analysis of the datasets and findings from the literature search. These will focus on urban planning strategies to minimize wildfire risks and methods to protect water resources from the adverse effects of wildfires.
