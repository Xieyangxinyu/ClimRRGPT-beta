The Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**

### Analysis of Fire Weather Index (FWI) Data for Las Vegas, NM

The Fire Weather Index (FWI) data for Las Vegas, NM, reveals a concerning trend in fire danger levels over the next few decades. Historically, from 1995 to 2004, the FWI values indicated a medium risk during spring, summer, and autumn, with lower risks in the winter. Specifically:
- **Spring:** 13.1 (Medium)
- **Summer:** 17.04 (Medium)
- **Autumn:** 19.31 (Medium)
- **Winter:** 6.98 (Low)

Looking ahead to the mid-century period (2045-2054), the projections show a slight increase in the FWI values, especially in spring:
- **Spring:** 17.31 (Medium)
- **Summer:** 18.26 (Medium)
- **Autumn:** 16.25 (Medium)
- **Winter:** 8.49 (Low)

By the end of the century (2085-2094), the spring season is expected to experience a significant increase in fire danger:
- **Spring:** 23.82 (High)
- **Summer:** 20.43 (Medium)
- **Autumn:** 20.5 (Medium)
- **Winter:** 11.52 (Medium)

This trend suggests an increasing risk of wildfires, particularly in the spring, which will necessitate enhanced fire management and urban planning strategies to mitigate risks to housing and water resources. The higher FWI values indicate drier and potentially windier conditions, which can facilitate the rapid spread of wildfires.

Given these projections, it is crucial to integrate robust wildfire risk management strategies into urban development plans for Las Vegas, NM. These should include considerations for fire-resistant building materials, strategic water resource management, and emergency response planning.

1. Title: Fire and sustainability: considerations for California’s altered future climate
Authors: Max Moritz, Scott Stephens
Year: 2008.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-007-9361-1
Abstract: In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, actions to achieve a sustainable coexistence with wildfire need to be taken now. In this paper we suggest several important policy, planning, and management changes that should be made, regardless of the many uncertainties in predicting future fire regimes. Similar to how other natural hazards are addressed, a risk-based framework for fire-related decisions is crucial. Reintroduction of fire to fire-prone ecosystems, careful use of fire surrogates, and creation of new and flexible policies will be needed for successful ecosystem management. Growing incompatibilities between urban development and wildfire also require a serious reevaluation of urban planning and building in fire-prone locations to reach a sustainable coexistence with fire. Our future cities and communities must be less susceptible to wildfire damage, and the ecosystems upon which we depend must be made more resilient to further disruptions in fire regimes.

2. Title: Adapt to more wildfire in western North American forests as climate changes
Authors: Tania Schoennagel et al.
Year: 2017.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1617464114
Abstract: Wildfires across western North America have increased in number and size over the past three decades, and this trend will continue in response to further warming. As a consequence, the wildland-urban interface is projected to experience substantially higher risk of climate-driven fires in the coming decades. Although many plants, animals, and ecosystem services benefit from fire, it is unknown how ecosystems will respond to increased burning and warming. Policy and management have focused primarily on specified resilience approaches aimed at resistance to wildfire and restoration of areas burned by wildfire through fire suppression and fuels management. These strategies are inadequate to address a new era of western wildfires. In contrast, policies that promote adaptive resilience to wildfire, by which people and ecosystems adjust and reorganize in response to changing fire regimes to reduce future vulnerability, are needed. Key aspects of an adaptive resilience approach are (i) recognizing that fuels reduction cannot alter regional wildfire trends; (ii) targeting fuels reduction to increase adaptation by some ecosystems and residential communities to more frequent fire; (iii) actively managing more wild and prescribed fires with a range of severities; and (iv) incentivizing and planning residential development to withstand inevitable wildfire. These strategies represent a shift in policy and management from restoring ecosystems based on historical baselines to adapting to changing fire regimes and from unsustainable defense of the wildland-urban interface to developing fire-adapted communities. We propose an approach that accepts wildfire as an inevitable catalyst of change and that promotes adaptive responses by ecosystems and residential communities to more warming and wildfire.

3. Title: The relation of landscape characteristics, human settlements, spatial planning, and fuel management with extreme wildfires
Authors: Christophe Bouillon et al.
Year: 2020.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815721-3.00004-7
Abstract: Abstract In this chapter we describe various situations concerning territories threatened by wildfire. The geographical history, rules evolution, and some facts will be presented. We highlight common problems and different situations and approaches in diverse countries in Europe and North America that experienced (or may experience) extreme wildfire events as a contribution for extreme fire prevention and management.
