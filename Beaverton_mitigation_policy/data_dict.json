You can access the website:https://disgeoportal.egs.anl.gov/ClimRR/\nThe Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**",

Title: Establishing Design Principles for Wildfire Resilient Urban Planning\nAuthors: Constanza Gonzalez-Mathiesen, Alan March\nYear: 2018.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/02697459.2018.1429787\nAbstract: ABSTRACTThis study elaborates on the built and natural environment disciplines\u2019 potential to develop applied understandings of resilience, using the example of land-use planning design guides in wildfire-prone areas. It argues that land-use planning can develop and apply spatial and physical resilience principles to disasters, contributing to developing meaningful ways of achieving resilience by bridging the space between overarching goals and the specificity of individual contexts, focusing on physical resistance. It concludes that there are nine design principles that can improve settlements resilience in wildfire-prone areas to reduce risks, organized under two major categories: acting on resistance and facilitating response.\n\n2. Title: A Socio-Ecological Approach to Mitigating Wildfire Vulnerability in the Wildland Urban Interface: A Case Study from the 2017 Thomas Fire\nAuthors: Crystal Kolden, Carol Henson\nYear: 2019.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/fire2010009\nAbstract: Wildfire disasters are one of the many consequences of increasing wildfire activities globally, and much effort has been made to identify strategies and actions for reducing human vulnerability to wildfire. While many individual homeowners and communities have enacted such strategies, the number subjected to a subsequent wildfire is considerably lower. Furthermore, there has been limited documentation on how mitigation strategies impact wildfire outcomes across the socio-ecological spectrum. Here we present a case report documenting wildfire vulnerability mitigation strategies undertaken by the community of Montecito, California, and how such strategies addressed exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. We utilize geospatial data, recorded interviews, and program documentation to synthesize how those strategies subsequently impacted the advance of the 2017 Thomas Fire on the community of Montecito under extreme fire danger conditions. Despite the extreme wind conditions and interviewee estimates of potentially hundreds of homes being consumed, only seven primary residences were destroyed by the Thomas Fire, and firefighters indicated that pre-fire mitigation activities played a clear, central role in the outcomes observed. This supports prior findings that community partnerships between agencies and citizens are critical for identifying and implementing place-based solutions to reducing wildfire vulnerability.\n\n3.

Fernandes et al.\nYear: 2020.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815721-3.00010-2\nAbstract: Abstract The genesis, evolution, and persistence of wildfire regulation policies and how misguided approaches are self-reinforced without due consideration or understanding of the roots and dynamics of the problem to be tackled are presented. Recommendations to replace fire exclusion policies with integrated fire management have been proposed over time, but their acceptance and degree of adoption have varied substantially. Persistence in seeing wildfire as a natural hazard and not as a multifaceted and complex social-ecological process shows how problem definition has a lasting influence on the decision-making process. A number of factors maintain the status quo of wildfire policies, mostly in the realm of social and political expectations and pressures, namely, preference given to short-term results, ignorance of risk management concepts, conflicting goals for resources management, institutional inertia or instability, and split responsibilities among agencies. General principles are presented for developing and implementing more effective and sustainable fire management policies.\n\n2.

In this context, the implications of various policy decisions are considered. The resulting decision rules take a form that makes it possible for existing wildfire management agencies to readily adopt them upon collection of the required data.\n\n3.

Title: Modelling of the Radiant Heat Flux and Rate of Spread of Wildfire within the Urban Environment\nAuthors: Greg Penney, Steven Richardson\nYear: 2019.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/fire2010004\nAbstract: One approach to increase community resilience to wildfire impacts is the enhancement of residential construction standards in an effort to provide protective shelters for families within their own homes. Current wildfire models reviewed in this study assume fire growth is unrestricted by vegetation fuel bed geometry; the head fire has attained a quasi-steady rate of spread; and the shielding effects of urban development are ignored. As a result, radiant heat flux may be significantly overestimated for small vegetation fires in road reserves, urban parklands, and similar scenarios. This paper proposes two new models to address this issue, and utilises two case studies for comparison against existing approaches. The findings are significant as this is the first study to analyse these factors from a fire engineering perspective, and to demonstrate that the use of landscape scale or siege wildfire models may not be appropriate within the urban context. The development of enhanced wildfire models will have a significant impact on town planning and construction practices in areas prone to wildfires, as well as firefighting suppression efforts when these events occur.\n\n2. Title: Fuel treatment prescriptions alter spatial patterns of fire severity around the wildland\u2013urban interface during the Wallow Fire, Arizona, USA\nAuthors: Maureen Kennedy, Morris Johnson\nYear: 2014.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2014.01.014\nAbstract: Fuel reduction treatments are implemented in the forest surrounding the wildland\u2013urban interface (WUI) to provide defensible space and safe opportunity for the protection of homes during a wildfire. The 2011 Wallow Fire in Arizona USA burned through recently implemented fuel treatments in the wildland surrounding residential communities in the WUI, and those fuel treatments have been credited with providing firefighter opportunities to protect residences during the Wallow Fire and thereby preventing the loss of homes that otherwise would have been burned. To characterize the spatial pattern of fire severity (represented by crown scorch and bole char) as the fire entered the treated areas from the wildland we fit non-linear models to the relationship between each severity metric and distance from the treatment edge in the direction of fire spread. The non-linear curve we chose provides an estimate of the distance into the treated area at which the severity metric is substantially reduced. Fire severity as measured by crown scorch and bole char was reduced a greater distance into the fuel treatment that allowed for clumps of trees and buffers for wildlife habitat than for the fuel treatment that resulted in evenly distributed trees with complete removal of ladder fuels. Crown scorch persisted further into the treated areas than did bole char, which implies that a high intensity surface fire was maintained in the treated areas. All of the fuel treatments we studied in the Wallow Fire demonstrated reduced fire severity before encountering residences in the WUI, demonstrating that there are multiple paths to fuel treatment design around the WUI.\n\n3.

Gill, Scott Stephens\nYear: 2009.0\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/4/3/034014\nAbstract: At their worst, fires at the rural\u2013urban or wildland\u2013urban interface cause tragic loss of human lives and homes, but mitigating these fire effects through management elicits many social and scientific challenges. This paper addresses four interconnected management challenges posed by socially disastrous landscape fires. The issues concern various assets (particularly houses, human life and biodiversity), fuel treatments, and fire and human behaviours. The topics considered are: 'asset protection zones'; 'defensible space' and urban fire spread in relation to house ignition and loss; 'stay-or-go' policy and the prediction of time available for safe egress and the possible conflict between the creation of defensible space and wildland management objectives. The first scientific challenge is to model the effective width of an asset protection zone of an urban area. The second is to consider the effect of vegetation around a house, potentially defensible space, on fire arrival at the structure. The third scientific challenge is to present stakeholders with accurate information on rates of spread, and where the fire front is located, so as to allow them to plan safe egress or preparation time in their particular circumstances. The fourth scientific challenge is to be able to predict the effects of fires on wildland species composition. Associated with each scientific challenge is a social challenge: for the first two scientific challenges the social challenge is to co-ordinate fuel management within and between the urban and rural or wildland sides of the interface. For the third scientific challenge, the social challenge is to be aware of, and appropriately use, fire danger information so that the potential for safe egress from a home can be estimated most accurately. Finally, the fourth social challenge is to for local residents of wildland\u2013urban interfaces with an interest in biodiversity conservation to understand the effects of fire regimes on biodiversity, thereby assisting hard-pressed wildland managers to make informed choices.",

Recent scholarly work points to vital insights that can guide communities like Beaverton in integrating these zones within their developmental strategies.\n\n**Greg Penney and Steven Richardson (2019)** explore innovative models that address the underestimate of radiant heat flux in urban areas with small vegetation fires. Their research underscores the significance of properly designed urban spaces that act as buffer zones, reducing the impact of wildfires in densely populated localities (Penney & Richardson, 2019). This approach demonstrates the potential of buffer zones to enhance resilience by mitigating fire spread and intensity before it reaches critical urban assets.\n\n**Maureen Kennedy and Morris Johnson (2014)** investigate the effects of fuel treatments as buffer zones during Arizona's 2011 Wallow Fire. Their analysis shows that these zones significantly lowered fire severity and provided firefighters better management options, thereby protecting urban interfaces (Kennedy & Johnson, 2014). This evidence supports the adjustment of spatial planning to include strategic buffer zones that reduce wildfire transmission to urban areas.\n\n**A. Gill and Scott Stephens (2009)** discuss the challenges and multifaceted benefits of integrating asset protection zones, which act similarly to buffer zones, in urban-wildland interfaces. They highlight planning strategies that combine urban development with natural landscape management to minimize fire risk impacts efficiently (Gill & Stephens, 2009). This work suggests that Beaverton would benefit from a holistic approach that balances fire protection, biodiversity, and residential needs.\n\n### References:\nPenney, G., & Richardson, S. (2019).
