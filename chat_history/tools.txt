Historically (1995 - 2004), the Fire Weather Index (FWI) for location (lat: 35.5939, lon: -105.2239) is 14.1583004 in spring, 17.83429909 in summer, 20.21240044 in autumn, and 7.00713167 in winter. In the mid-century (2045 - 2054), the FWI is projected to be 18.6753006 in spring, 19.09799957 in summer, 17.17200089 in autumn, and 8.55791358 in winter. In the end-of-century (2085 - 2094), the FWI is projected to be 25.47319984 in spring, 22.27549934 in summer, 21.74290085 in autumn and 11.73830099 in winter.

The Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**

Please analyze and interpret FWI numbers in [specified region] in the style of a research scientist in 100 words or less:
- Explain what these FWI numbers indicate about future fire risks and how they compare to historical trends. **In particular, whether FWI number is high for this location.** 
- Contextualize your data. How do these values relate to [your client's specific query or concern]? For example, how does the trend impact the user's community or industry? What's the broader impact on the people and the economy?
- Offer insights based on these trends. 
- Provide the link to the data source for these FWI values. 
- Ask if your client has any questions, or you can proceed to the next step.### Analysis and Interpretation of FWI Data:

The Fire Weather Index (FWI) values show a significant increase from the historical period (1995 - 2004) to the future projections for mid-century (2045 - 2054) and end-of-century (2085 - 2094). Historically, the FWI values were 7.0 to 20.2 across seasons, indicative of moderate fire risks. Projected values increase notably, especially in spring (25.5) and winter (11.7) by the end of the century, signaling a substantial rise in fire danger.

### Contextual Analysis:

This upward trend suggests heightened wildfire risks for the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and surrounding areas, impacting both natural ecosystems and human communities. For a risk manager, this entails increased frequency and intensity of fires, challenging emergency response and necessitating stronger preparedness and mitigation strategies.

### Insights:

Immediate action is required to manage and mitigate this growing risk. Enhanced vegetation management, updated community preparedness plans, and improved emergency response strategies are crucial. These trends highlight the urgency of incorporating climate projections into risk management processes.

2. Title: Landscape-based fire scenarios and fire types in the Ayllón massif (Central Mountain Range, Spain), 19th and 20th centuries
Authors: Catarina Sequeira, Cristina Montiel-Molina, Francisco Rego
Year: 2019.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.18172/cig.3796
Abstract: Wildfires have been a major landscape disturbance factor throughout history in inland mountain areas of Spain. This paper aims to understand the interaction of fire regimes and landscape dynamics during the last two centuries within a socio-spatial context. The study area selected for this historical and spatial analysis is the Ayllon massif, in the Central Mountain Range. The theoretical background used to identify the driving forces of fire regime changes over the 19th and 20th centuries in this mountain area includes landscape-based fire scenarios and fire-type concepts. Both concepts have been addressed in recent studies from a spatial planning and fire management approach in an attempt to understand current fire landscapes and wildfire risk. However, this is the first time that these concepts have been applied to show that both spatial and temporal scales are crucial for an understanding of the current wildfire panorama, and that fire history related to landscape dynamics is fundamental in socio-spatial differences in fire regimes. Four variables (fire history, land use, population and settlement system, and forest management) were assessed to define historical landscape-based fire scenarios, and three fire feature variables (fire extent, fire cause, and spatial distribution pattern) were considered to define historical fire-types. We found that the non-linear evolution of fire regimes during the 19th and 20th centuries was determined by fire-type changes according to landscape dynamics. Moreover, population and forest management have been the main driving forces of fire regime tipping points or pyrotransitions. This study validates the hypothesis that fire regime changes are the result of the interaction of fire history and landscape dynamics.

3. Title: Influence of landscape gradients in wilderness management and spatial climate on fire severity in the Northern Rockies USA, 1984 to 2010
Authors: Sandra Haire, Carol Miller, Kevin McGarigal
Year: 2015.0
Abstract: Management activities, applied over broad scales, can potentially affect attributes of fire regimes including fire severity. Wilderness landscapes provide a natural laboratory for exploring effects of management because in some federally designated wilderness areas the burning of naturally ignited fires is promoted. In order to better understand the contribution of fire management activities to fire effects, we examined patterns of severity across a management gradient defined by wilderness-non-wilderness boundaries in a northern Rocky Mountain study region. We identified a significant positive effect of the management gradient on severity for the time period 1984 to 2010, but the magnitude and direction of effects varied from year to year. However, the influence of management on severity was subsumed by the influence of spatial climate. Our findings represent an important step in constructing predictive models of severity with changes in both climate and fire management practices.
