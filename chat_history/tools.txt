The Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**

1. Title: Managing Wildfire Risks: Effects on Water Resources With and Without Fuel Treatment
Authors: Jay O'Laughlin, Alan Ager
Year: 2007.0
Abstract: Wildfire poses policy, management, scientific, and technical challenges for water resource systems. The challenges of wildland fire management are increasing for a variety of reasons. Most terrestrial ecosystems in the western states were born of and maintained by fire. Wildfire suppression over many decades has led to fuel accumulations posing high or moderate ecological risks on 141 million acres of federal lands. Under droughty conditions such fuel loads can produce uncharacteristically intense wildfires and increase the severity of adverse effects on, among other things, water bodies and riparian areas. The resource manager's working hypothesis is that fire behavior can be modified by reducing fuels on the landscape, thereby reducing risks to valuable resources. The federal wildfire policy states that risk management undergirds all wildland fire management activities. Risk cannot be managed until it has been assessed. Risk assessment techniques can be used to test the working hypothesis. We work down through various scales to provide an overview of risk assessment tools that use landscape characteristics, fire behavior, and values at risk that help identify fuel treatment priority areas. In collaborative settings map-based tools can demonstrate to stakeholders that strategic placement of treatments can reduce wildfire extent. At the project-level scale (< 20,000 acres), decisions to implement fuels treatment on federal lands generally must be supported by environmental impact assessments demonstrating that the project will reduce wildfire risks without adversely affecting the water quality parameters associated with fish habitat. Shortand long-term effects must be considered. Sediment is used to demonstrate adaptation of the Environmental Protection Agency's ecological risk assessment framework, which is driven by stakeholder involvement, for the fire/fish risk assessment tradeoff problem. The key is including the long term benefits of fuel treatment on sediment regimes into a decision model framework. An application using Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) Internet-based tools is presented. Author Contact Information: Jay J. O’Laughlin jayo@uidaho.edu

2. Title: Strategic application of wildland fire suppression in the southwestern United States
Authors: Jesse Young et al.
Year: 2019.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.01.003
Abstract: Abstract Much of the western United States is experiencing longer fire seasons with an increased frequency of high-severity fires and fire risk. Fire managers in the southwestern United States have increased efforts to reduce fire risk by managing more fires to meet resource objectives (e.g. thin forests, reduce hazardous fuel loads, and restore the landscape). However, little is known about the situational circumstances and decision space that inform the strategic response to wildland fire. Using generalized and time-to-event modeling techniques, we examined how fire management decisions are reached in a context informed by weather, burning conditions, and subsequent fire behavior. Modeling results captured daily containment probabilities along a gradient from limiting natural conditions to suppression invoked containment. Results inform fire management decisions, future research efforts, and the simulation of wildland fires with resource objectives.

3. Title: Calculation of Critical Water Flow Rates for Wildfire Suppression
Authors: Greg Penney et al.
Year: 2019.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/fire2010003
Abstract: Predicting water suppression requirements and its impacts on firefighting strategies and logistics within the urban environment has been the subject of many previous studies, however the same level of research has yet to be applied in the realm of wildfire suppression. To work towards addressing this knowledge gap, this paper provides guidance for Incident Controllers in relation to critical water flow rates required to extinguish large wildfire across a wide range of forest fuel loads, fire weather and active fire front depths. This is achieved through mathematical empirical analysis of water flow rates required for head fire suppression during 540 simulated wildfires in forest vegetation. This research applies a fire engineering approach to wildfire suppression logistics and deterministically assess the suitability of appliance and aircraft based head fire suppression. The results highlight the limitations of offensive wildfire suppression involving direct head fire attacks by appliances once wildfires attain a quasi-steady state in forest fuels.

**LLM Response**
In response to the increasing high-intensity fires near Las Vegas, NM, several academic papers provide insights on managing wildfire risks effectively, especially considering the area's limited water resources.

According to O'Laughlin and Ager (2007), effective management of wildfires involves not just suppression but strategic fuel treatment to reduce fire severity and protect water resources. This might be particularly relevant for Las Vegas, NM, where water is a scarce resource and management of landscape fuels can mitigate the impacts on water quality and availability during and after wildfires (O'Laughshot & Ager, 2007).

Jesse Young and colleagues (2019) emphasized the enhanced use of strategic fire suppression techniques in the southwestern United States to manage the longer, more severe fire seasons. Their work suggests that understanding specific situational circumstances like weather conditions and fire behavior can inform better wildfire management decisions, which may help in preparing Las Vegas, NM, for effective firefightive actions during critical periods (Young et al., 2019).

Lastly, Greg Penney and his team (2019) focus on determining critical water flow rates needed for effective wildfire suppression. This research can guide the local risk managers in Las Vegas, NM, on how to optimize the use of limited water resources during firefightive operations, ensuring that water is used effectively to combat wildfires without wastage (Penney et al., 2019).

1. Title: Subdivision Policy and Planning for Bushfire Defence: A Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy for Residential Peri-Urban Regions in Victoria, Australia
Authors: TESSA BOND, DAVID MERCER
Year: 2014.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-5871.12040
Abstract: From time to time, catastrophic bushfires cause substantial losses of life and property in southern Australia. Moreover, recent analyses of longitudinal fire weather behaviour point to a steady increase in the Forest Fire Danger Index. Although natural hazards such as bushfires can rarely be prevented, effective hazard-mitigation strategies can manage and lessen the impact on humans and the environment. This paper investigates subdivision design as one such mitigation technique. Roads and other forms of access are vital to successful bushfire response by fire brigades. The research examines the effectiveness of current policy to provide adequate access and suppression opportunities for firefighters in peri-urban areas, with particular reference to Victoria. Subdivision policies applicable to development in bushfire-prone areas throughout Australia and the United States are assessed and compared. Interviews with firefighters, planners, and researchers provided insight into the key components of the road network which facilitate firefighter access and identified major shortfalls of current policy and practice in Victoria.

2. Title: Re‐introducing fire at the urban/wild‐land interface: planning for success
Authors: Steven Miller, Dale Wade
Year: 2003.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/forestry/76.2.253
Abstract: The application of fire in the southern United States continues to increase in complexity due to urban sprawl, air quality issues and regulatory constraints. Many sites suffer from unnaturally high fuel accumulations dueto decades of fire exclusion. The loss of habitat to urbanization and successional changes resulting from the absence of fire increases the importance of restoring and maintaining those remaining acres. The wild-land/urban interface case study we discuss herein includes several fire-adapted plant communities ranging in required fire regime from frequent low-intensity fires to infrequent high-intensity stand replacement fires. This area has experienced extended fire-free periods and includes tightly packed homes in subdivisions developed with no consideration of the potential fOr wild-land fire. Additional smoke-sensitive areas include schools and heavily travelled highways. Such worst-case scenarios exponentially increase the challenges/risks facing fire managers. This case study thus illustrates many of the complex societal issues and technical challenges facing fire managers when planning and conducting restoration burns in the wild-land/urban interface. In fact, it reinforces the notion that, when burning in the wild-land/urban interface, executing the burn often requires less effort than the planning, co-operation and co-ordination necessary prior to ignition.

3. Title: Wildfire exposure to the wildland urban interface in the western US
Authors: Alan Ager et al.
Year: 2019.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.102059
Abstract: Abstract Predicting wildfire disasters presents a major challenge to the field of risk science, especially when fires propagate long distances through diverse fuel types and complex terrain. A good example is in the western US where large tracts of public lands routinely experience large fires that spread from remote wildlands into developed areas and cause structure loss and fatalities. In this paper we provide the first comprehensive assessment of where public wildlands potentially contribute wildfire exposure to communities in the 11 western US states. We used simulation modeling to map and characterize the composition of the source landscapes (firesheds) and recipient communities in terms of fuels, fire behavior and forest management suitability. The information was used to build a prototype investment prioritization framework that targets highly exposed communities where forest and fuel management activities are feasible. We found that simulated wildfires ignited on national forests can potentially affect about half of the communities in the western US (2560 out of 5118), with 90% of exposure affecting the top 20% of the communities (n = 516). Firesheds within national forests, defined as areas that have the potential to expose communities to fire, were estimated at 35 million ha (62% of the total national forest area), and were almost three times larger than the affected community lands. Large contiguous areas of wildfire transmission were evident on a number of national forests. Only 22% of the fireshed area is forested, fire-adapted, and lies within land management designations that allow mechanical fuels management. The methods demonstrate how cross-boundary exposure can be factored into prioritizing federal investments in hazardous fuels reduction on national forests in concert with community protection measures. The results can also help scale wildfire governance systems to match the geography of risk from large wildfire events, which augments existing assessments that do not explicitly identify the source of risk to communities.

**LLM Response**
Recent academic findings emphasize the significance of improving access through unpaved roads for efficient wildfire management, particularly in high-risk areas like Las Vegas, NM. These strategies are crucial in mitigating the devastating impacts of wildfires in regions with challenging terrains and limited water resources.

Tessa Bond and David Mercer (2014) highlight the importance of subdivision policy in enhancing bushfire defense. Their research underscores the necessity for well-designed roads and access paths that are critical for the effective movement of firefighting equipment, thereby significantly improving response capabilities in fire-prone areas (Bond & Mercer, 2014).

Steven Miller and Dale Wade (2003) discuss the reintroduction of controlled fires at the urban/wildland interface, pinpointing the complexity that comes with planning such operations due to the proximity to urban areas. They emphasize the essential role of strategic planning in collaboration with road access improvements, which aids in managing vegetation and mitigating fire risks effectively (Miller & Wade, 2003).

Furthermore, Alan Ager and his team (2019) provide insights through simulation modeling that evaluates wildfire exposure risks to communities. Their studies suggest that strategic infrastructural enhancements, including road improvements, can significantly bolster defense mechanisms against potential wildfire threats by facilitating quicker emergency responses and more effective fire suppression activities (Ager et al., 2019).

The Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**

1. Title: Water Source Protection Funds as a Tool to Address Climate Adaptation and Resiliency in Southwestern Forests
Authors: Laura Falk McCarthy
Year: 2016.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5876/9781607324591.c011
Abstract: Wildfire intensity in the Southwestern United States has increased over the last decade corresponding with dense fuels and higher temperatures. For example, in New Mexico on the 2011 Las Conchas fire, intense fire and wind-driven fire behavior resulted in large areas of moderate and high severity burn (42 percent of burned area) with roughly 65,000 acres (26,300 ha) left largely without green trees or seed sources. Monsoon rains fell in several drainages that sustained high severity burn, and these moderate rainfall events triggered massive debris flows. Debris from one canyon deposited 70 feet of ash at the confluence with the Rio Grande. The cities of Albuquerque and Santa Fe stopped using river water for municipal needs for 40 and 20 days, respectively, demonstrating the significant impact of wildfire and post-fire debris flow on municipal water users. This paper examines two case studies in New Mexico that have applied or are seeking to apply the water fund model to watersheds dominated by national forest system lands. The first case study is the Santa Fe Water Source Protection Fund established in 2009, and the second case study is the Middle Rio Grande and Forested Watersheds Fund, expected to launch in July 2014. Both case studies illustrate multiple sectors of government and community interests responding to the need to protect water sources, and joining together to generate the financial resources for rapid action to improve forest resiliency in the face of climate change.

2. Title: Wildfire Policy and Public Lands: Integrating Scientific Understanding with Social Concerns across Landscapes
Authors: MICHAEL P. DOMBECK, JACK E. WILLIAMS, CHRISTOPHER A. WOOD
Year: 2004.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00491.x
Abstract: Efforts to suppress wildfires have become increasingly problematic in recent years as costs have risen, threats to firefighter safety have escalated, and detrimental impacts to ecosystems have multiplied. Wildfires that escape initial suppression often expand into large, high-intensity summer blazes. Lost is the legacy of smaller fires that likely burned outside extreme weather and fuel conditions and resulted in less severe impacts. Despite the recognized need for modifications to existing policies and practices, resource agencies have been slow to respond. The spread of exotic species, climate change, and increasing human development in wildlands further complicates the issue. New policies are needed that integrate social and ecological needs across administrative boundaries and broad landscapes. These policies should promote a continuum of treatments with active management and reduction of fuel hazard in wildland-urban interface zones and reintroduction of fire in wildlands. Management goals should focus on restoration of the long-term ecological health of the land. Projects that reduce fuel loads but compromise the integrity of soil, water supplies, or watersheds will do more harm than good in the long run. Despite significant ecological concerns, learning to live with fire remains primarily a social issue that will require greater political leadership, agency innovation, public involvement, and community responsibility.

3. Title: Managing Wildfire Risks: Effects on Water Resources With and Without Fuel Treatment
Authors: Jay O'Laughlin, Alan Ager
Year: 2007.0
Abstract: Wildfire poses policy, management, scientific, and technical challenges for water resource systems. The challenges of wildland fire management are increasing for a variety of reasons. Most terrestrial ecosystems in the western states were born of and maintained by fire. Wildfire suppression over many decades has led to fuel accumulations posing high or moderate ecological risks on 141 million acres of federal lands. Under droughty conditions such fuel loads can produce uncharacteristically intense wildfires and increase the severity of adverse effects on, among other things, water bodies and riparian areas. The resource manager's working hypothesis is that fire behavior can be modified by reducing fuels on the landscape, thereby reducing risks to valuable resources. The federal wildfire policy states that risk management undergirds all wildland fire management activities. Risk cannot be managed until it has been assessed. Risk assessment techniques can be used to test the working hypothesis. We work down through various scales to provide an overview of risk assessment tools that use landscape characteristics, fire behavior, and values at risk that help identify fuel treatment priority areas. In collaborative settings map-based tools can demonstrate to stakeholders that strategic placement of treatments can reduce wildfire extent. At the project-level scale (< 20,000 acres), decisions to implement fuels treatment on federal lands generally must be supported by environmental impact assessments demonstrating that the project will reduce wildfire risks without adversely affecting the water quality parameters associated with fish habitat. Shortand long-term effects must be considered. Sediment is used to demonstrate adaptation of the Environmental Protection Agency's ecological risk assessment framework, which is driven by stakeholder involvement, for the fire/fish risk assessment tradeoff problem. The key is including the long term benefits of fuel treatment on sediment regimes into a decision model framework. An application using Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) Internet-based tools is presented. Author Contact Information: Jay J. O’Laughlin jayo@uidaho.edu

### Relevance of Recent Research to Wildfire Management in Las Vegas, NM Area

In light of the current fire risks near Las Vegas, NM, recent scientific literature presents innovative strategies for wildfire management that align well with the region's needs. Laura Falk McCarthy (2016) discusses the use of Water Source Protection Funds, which can be pivotal in safeguarding water resources by establishing financial reserves for rapid response and forest resilience enhancement against climate change impacts (McCarthy, 2016). This approach is particularly relevant as it can directly support water management in areas vulnerable to fire-related debris flows, as witnessed in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.

Additionally, Michael P. Dombeck and colleagues (2004) argue for the integration of scientific understanding with public concerns, suggesting that effective wildfire policy requires a balance of ecological needs and social considerations (Dombeck, Williams, & Wood, 2004). Their emphasis on adopting a continuum of treatments, such as fuel reduction in interface zones and reintroduction of fire in wildlands, can enhance accessibility and safety on unpaved roads, crucial for effective emergency responses and community protection in the Las Vegas, NM area.

Lastly, Jay O'Laughlin and Alan Ager (2007) highlight the importance of managing wildfire risks through strategic fuel treatments to protect water resources (O'Laughlin & Ager, 2007). Given the heightened fire risks identified in your area, these strategic placements can reduce both the extent of wildfires and their impact on water quality, aligning with your focus on improving water resource management.

The Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**
