The Fire Weather Index (FWI) estimates wildfire danger using weather conditions that influence the spread of wildfires. The FWI is comprised of multiple components that are developed using daily readings of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour precipitation. This weather information is used to estimate the total fuel available for combustion (dry organic material) and the rate of fire spread. The FWI is useful for evaluating weather-based conditions that heighten the danger of wildfire spread once ignition has occurred; it does not account for sources of ignition, which can have both natural and human causes. Areas in the U.S. Southwest, which are often exceptionally dry, will have higher average daily FWI values than areas in the Northeast. **Values above 25 typically represent a high level of danger in the northern regions, whereas values above 40-45 often represent a high level of danger in the Southwest.**

1. Title: Managing Wildfire Risks: Effects on Water Resources With and Without Fuel Treatment
Authors: Jay O'Laughlin, Alan Ager
Year: 2007.0
Abstract: Wildfire poses policy, management, scientific, and technical challenges for water resource systems. The challenges of wildland fire management are increasing for a variety of reasons. Most terrestrial ecosystems in the western states were born of and maintained by fire. Wildfire suppression over many decades has led to fuel accumulations posing high or moderate ecological risks on 141 million acres of federal lands. Under droughty conditions such fuel loads can produce uncharacteristically intense wildfires and increase the severity of adverse effects on, among other things, water bodies and riparian areas. The resource manager's working hypothesis is that fire behavior can be modified by reducing fuels on the landscape, thereby reducing risks to valuable resources. The federal wildfire policy states that risk management undergirds all wildland fire management activities. Risk cannot be managed until it has been assessed. Risk assessment techniques can be used to test the working hypothesis. We work down through various scales to provide an overview of risk assessment tools that use landscape characteristics, fire behavior, and values at risk that help identify fuel treatment priority areas. In collaborative settings map-based tools can demonstrate to stakeholders that strategic placement of treatments can reduce wildfire extent. At the project-level scale (< 20,000 acres), decisions to implement fuels treatment on federal lands generally must be supported by environmental impact assessments demonstrating that the project will reduce wildfire risks without adversely affecting the water quality parameters associated with fish habitat. Shortand long-term effects must be considered. Sediment is used to demonstrate adaptation of the Environmental Protection Agency's ecological risk assessment framework, which is driven by stakeholder involvement, for the fire/fish risk assessment tradeoff problem. The key is including the long term benefits of fuel treatment on sediment regimes into a decision model framework. An application using Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) Internet-based tools is presented. Author Contact Information: Jay J. O’Laughlin jayo@uidaho.edu

2. Title: Strategic application of wildland fire suppression in the southwestern United States
Authors: Jesse Young et al.
Year: 2019.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.01.003
Abstract: Abstract Much of the western United States is experiencing longer fire seasons with an increased frequency of high-severity fires and fire risk. Fire managers in the southwestern United States have increased efforts to reduce fire risk by managing more fires to meet resource objectives (e.g. thin forests, reduce hazardous fuel loads, and restore the landscape). However, little is known about the situational circumstances and decision space that inform the strategic response to wildland fire. Using generalized and time-to-event modeling techniques, we examined how fire management decisions are reached in a context informed by weather, burning conditions, and subsequent fire behavior. Modeling results captured daily containment probabilities along a gradient from limiting natural conditions to suppression invoked containment. Results inform fire management decisions, future research efforts, and the simulation of wildland fires with resource objectives.

3. Title: Calculation of Critical Water Flow Rates for Wildfire Suppression
Authors: Greg Penney et al.
Year: 2019.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/fire2010003
Abstract: Predicting water suppression requirements and its impacts on firefighting strategies and logistics within the urban environment has been the subject of many previous studies, however the same level of research has yet to be applied in the realm of wildfire suppression. To work towards addressing this knowledge gap, this paper provides guidance for Incident Controllers in relation to critical water flow rates required to extinguish large wildfire across a wide range of forest fuel loads, fire weather and active fire front depths. This is achieved through mathematical empirical analysis of water flow rates required for head fire suppression during 540 simulated wildfires in forest vegetation. This research applies a fire engineering approach to wildfire suppression logistics and deterministically assess the suitability of appliance and aircraft based head fire suppression. The results highlight the limitations of offensive wildfire suppression involving direct head fire attacks by appliances once wildfires attain a quasi-steady state in forest fuels.

**LLM Response**
In response to the increasing high-intensity fires near Las Vegas, NM, several academic papers provide insights on managing wildfire risks effectively, especially considering the area's limited water resources.

According to O'Laughlin and Ager (2007), effective management of wildfires involves not just suppression but strategic fuel treatment to reduce fire severity and protect water resources. This might be particularly relevant for Las Vegas, NM, where water is a scarce resource and management of landscape fuels can mitigate the impacts on water quality and availability during and after wildfires (O'Laughshot & Ager, 2007).

Jesse Young and colleagues (2019) emphasized the enhanced use of strategic fire suppression techniques in the southwestern United States to manage the longer, more severe fire seasons. Their work suggests that understanding specific situational circumstances like weather conditions and fire behavior can inform better wildfire management decisions, which may help in preparing Las Vegas, NM, for effective firefightive actions during critical periods (Young et al., 2019).

Lastly, Greg Penney and his team (2019) focus on determining critical water flow rates needed for effective wildfire suppression. This research can guide the local risk managers in Las Vegas, NM, on how to optimize the use of limited water resources during firefightive operations, ensuring that water is used effectively to combat wildfires without wastage (Penney et al., 2019).

1. Title: Subdivision Policy and Planning for Bushfire Defence: A Natural Hazard Mitigation Strategy for Residential Peri-Urban Regions in Victoria, Australia
Authors: TESSA BOND, DAVID MERCER
Year: 2014.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-5871.12040
Abstract: From time to time, catastrophic bushfires cause substantial losses of life and property in southern Australia. Moreover, recent analyses of longitudinal fire weather behaviour point to a steady increase in the Forest Fire Danger Index. Although natural hazards such as bushfires can rarely be prevented, effective hazard-mitigation strategies can manage and lessen the impact on humans and the environment. This paper investigates subdivision design as one such mitigation technique. Roads and other forms of access are vital to successful bushfire response by fire brigades. The research examines the effectiveness of current policy to provide adequate access and suppression opportunities for firefighters in peri-urban areas, with particular reference to Victoria. Subdivision policies applicable to development in bushfire-prone areas throughout Australia and the United States are assessed and compared. Interviews with firefighters, planners, and researchers provided insight into the key components of the road network which facilitate firefighter access and identified major shortfalls of current policy and practice in Victoria.

2. Title: Re‐introducing fire at the urban/wild‐land interface: planning for success
Authors: Steven Miller, Dale Wade
Year: 2003.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/forestry/76.2.253
Abstract: The application of fire in the southern United States continues to increase in complexity due to urban sprawl, air quality issues and regulatory constraints. Many sites suffer from unnaturally high fuel accumulations dueto decades of fire exclusion. The loss of habitat to urbanization and successional changes resulting from the absence of fire increases the importance of restoring and maintaining those remaining acres. The wild-land/urban interface case study we discuss herein includes several fire-adapted plant communities ranging in required fire regime from frequent low-intensity fires to infrequent high-intensity stand replacement fires. This area has experienced extended fire-free periods and includes tightly packed homes in subdivisions developed with no consideration of the potential fOr wild-land fire. Additional smoke-sensitive areas include schools and heavily travelled highways. Such worst-case scenarios exponentially increase the challenges/risks facing fire managers. This case study thus illustrates many of the complex societal issues and technical challenges facing fire managers when planning and conducting restoration burns in the wild-land/urban interface. In fact, it reinforces the notion that, when burning in the wild-land/urban interface, executing the burn often requires less effort than the planning, co-operation and co-ordination necessary prior to ignition.

3. Title: Wildfire exposure to the wildland urban interface in the western US
Authors: Alan Ager et al.
Year: 2019.0
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.102059
Abstract: Abstract Predicting wildfire disasters presents a major challenge to the field of risk science, especially when fires propagate long distances through diverse fuel types and complex terrain. A good example is in the western US where large tracts of public lands routinely experience large fires that spread from remote wildlands into developed areas and cause structure loss and fatalities. In this paper we provide the first comprehensive assessment of where public wildlands potentially contribute wildfire exposure to communities in the 11 western US states. We used simulation modeling to map and characterize the composition of the source landscapes (firesheds) and recipient communities in terms of fuels, fire behavior and forest management suitability. The information was used to build a prototype investment prioritization framework that targets highly exposed communities where forest and fuel management activities are feasible. We found that simulated wildfires ignited on national forests can potentially affect about half of the communities in the western US (2560 out of 5118), with 90% of exposure affecting the top 20% of the communities (n = 516). Firesheds within national forests, defined as areas that have the potential to expose communities to fire, were estimated at 35 million ha (62% of the total national forest area), and were almost three times larger than the affected community lands. Large contiguous areas of wildfire transmission were evident on a number of national forests. Only 22% of the fireshed area is forested, fire-adapted, and lies within land management designations that allow mechanical fuels management. The methods demonstrate how cross-boundary exposure can be factored into prioritizing federal investments in hazardous fuels reduction on national forests in concert with community protection measures. The results can also help scale wildfire governance systems to match the geography of risk from large wildfire events, which augments existing assessments that do not explicitly identify the source of risk to communities.

Recent academic findings emphasize the significance of improving access through unpaved roads for efficient wildfire management, particularly in high-risk areas like Las Vegas, NM. These strategies are crucial in mitigating the devastating impacts of wildfires in regions with challenging terrains and limited water resources.

Tessa Bond and David Mercer (2014) highlight the importance of subdivision policy in enhancing bushfire defense. Their research underscores the necessity for well-designed roads and access paths that are critical for the effective movement of firefighting equipment, thereby significantly improving response capabilities in fire-prone areas (Bond & Mercer, 2014).

Steven Miller and Dale Wade (2003) discuss the reintroduction of controlled fires at the urban/wildland interface, pinpointing the complexity that comes with planning such operations due to the proximity to urban areas. They emphasize the essential role of strategic planning in collaboration with road access improvements, which aids in managing vegetation and mitigating fire risks effectively (Miller & Wade, 2003).

Furthermore, Alan Ager and his team (2019) provide insights through simulation modeling that evaluates wildfire exposure risks to communities. Their studies suggest that strategic infrastructural enhancements, including road improvements, can significantly bolster defense mechanisms against potential wildfire threats by facilitating quicker emergency responses and more effective fire suppression activities (Ager et al., 2019).
