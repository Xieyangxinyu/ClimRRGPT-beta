**Step 1: Data Analysis:** I will analyze the Recent fire incident data focusing on the specifics of the recent fires around the latitude 35.86456960744962 and longitude -105.35888671875. This analysis will provide insights on the frequency, severity, and spread pattern of the fires, crucial for assessing the immediate impact on the area's water resources.
**Step 2: Literature Search:** My search will focus on existing scientific papers discussing the impact of wildfires on water resources, particularly issues like contamination, sedimentation, and changes in water runoff patterns. I will also look for successful mitigation measures applicable to the type of geography and ecosystem of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.
**Step 3: Recommendations:** Based on the data analysis and literature search, I will compile a set of immediate and long-term recommendations to protect and manage affected water resources, mitigate the impact of future fire incidents, and enhance the resilience of the ecosystem and local communities.
