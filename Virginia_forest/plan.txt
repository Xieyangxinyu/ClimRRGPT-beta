**Step 1: Data Analysis with Recent Fire Incident Data**
Given your concern about potential wildfire risks in the last 5-10 years and the need for immediate implementation of recommendations, I will analyze the Recent fire incident data for the Covington, VA area. This analysis will focus on identifying the frequency, severity, and proximity of recent wildfire incidents to your property, which will help in understanding current risk levels and trends.

**Step 2: Literature Search on Forest Management and Wildfire Mitigation**
Based on your specific interest in maintaining the health of oak and cherry trees and managing the forest near the urban-wildfire interface, I'll search for scientific literature. This includes effective forest management practices applicable to your forest composition, specifically focusing on conifer and broadleaf species. Additionally, I will look into strategies for wildfire risk mitigation at the urban-wildforest interface, such as creating defensible spaces, the use of fire-resistant vegetation, and community-level wildfire preparedness.

**Step 3: Recommendations**
Utilizing insights gained from both the data analysis and the literature search, I will provide recommendations that align with your goals. These will include forest management practices to enhance the health and productivity of oak and cherry trees, as well as specific actions you can take to mitigate wildfire risks. This may involve strategic tree removal, controlled burns, or adjustments to the landscaping closer to your home to enhance fire resistance.
